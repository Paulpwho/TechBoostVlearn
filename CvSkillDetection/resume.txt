About me
I am currently working as a Software Engineering at Vodafone in their future comms team. My current interests are in programming and software development. I have experience in Java, Vb.net, python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ and more. Independent projects I’ve taken part in have usually been related to programming solutions that are research based.
Recent Project:
Decompiling EVM bytecode to C
https://github.com/kristielGJ/DecompilingEVMtoC
Academic proposal supervised by Martin Nyx Brain and Michał Król. The project is a decompiler that converts EVM byte code (Ethereum byte code) into C which can be handled by CPROVER tools. This could enable us to identify hidden bugs in EVM code such as Solidity programs.
